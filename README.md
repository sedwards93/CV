Hello! I'm Symion, a junior full stack developer and recent Makers Academy graduate. With a commitment to self-improvement, over the last 6 months I have taken a dive head-first into the world of tech, eagerly gaining experience with a wide variety of technologies as well as practicing principles such as OOP, TDD, version control and Agile. A career-changer, with extensive experience within higher education and the public sector, I am eager to continue my coding venture using my logic and creativity to build usable and intuitive products. 



## Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **[Triffid](https://github.com/samanthagottlieb/triffid)**            | Never kill your houseplants again! Built for my Makers final project, Triffid is a houseplant monitoring app designed to help users keep track of their leafy friends. We used Node.js and Express.js to create a fully RESTful backend, and React Native for the interface, facilitating use on both iOS and Android devices. Features include JWT authentication, the ability to add plants to a personal 'terrarium', and a connection to the Trefle API plant database. Read about my personal experience on this project [here](https://symion-edwards.medium.com/week-of-the-triffids-building-a-houseplant-app-for-my-bootcamp-final-project-225b59c816f7).   | MongoDB, Express.JS, React Native, Node.js, JWT, Jest, [Trefle API](https://trefle.io/)|
| **[Bragbook](https://github.com/CodeZeus-dev/acebook-SassBook)** | Finally, a social media platform unashamedly transparent with its intensions! Bragbook is a full stack Rails Facebook clone designed to make showing off about your life easy. This two week group project was my first introduction to the Ruby on Rails framework.  We worked in two day sprints using Agile processes, and followed CI/CD pipelines for rapid integration. Users can create an account, upload a profile picture, create/update/delete/edit posts, like and comment on posts and add friends. | Ruby on Rails, Rspec, Capybara, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Travis CI, Heroku |
| **[Sym's Pins](https://github.com/sedwards93/bowling-challenge)** | Who knew that the logic behind 10 pin bowling was so intricate?! Sym's Pins is my attempt creating a bowling scorecard that allows a user to keep track of their score across a 10 frame game of bowling. Test-driven with the Jasmine framework, and written using JavaScript ES6 classes, this project was my first dive into object orientated design in JavaScript. The user interface is written using HTML, CSS and the jQuery library for JavaScript. The app is deployed on [Heroku.](https://sympinbowling.herokuapp.com/) | JavaScript, jQuery, Jasmine, HTML, CSS, Heroku |
| **[symion.co.uk](https://github.com/sedwards93/symion.co.uk)** | An exercise in design, I worked on this single page application to refine my front end design process. Through creating website mock-ups using Figma, I was able to see through my design from conception to completion, creating a fully-responsive splash-screen website with links to my professional socials. I deployed my serverless website using [Netlify.](https://www.symion.co.uk/)  | Figma, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Netlify |

## Skills

#### Communicator
I have channelled my passion for communication through my personal blog, where I have written articles for Medium's largest publication, the Start-up, and won the bi-annual Maker's blogging competition. My aptitude for confident and concise communication stems from my science background, in which my Biology degree helped develop my analytical and research skills and taught me to approach problems methodically and rationally. I have carried through my aptitude for assimilating information and written communication into my coding process as well as professional career, having recently supported the University of East Anglia’s Sustainability, Utilities and Engineering team research, edit and write their annual environmental report.

#### Stickler for detail
I have an attentive eye for detail, reinforced by my extensive office experience. I take satisfaction in working productively, which I demonstrated during my time at Norfolk County Council, where I automated some of my responsibilities using basic Excel macros. My secretarial responsibilities strengthened my appreciation for the importance of time management and working to deadlines, which I have continued to apply to my coding process, and has helped keep structure and motivation to my post-Makers routine. My detailed-orientated approach to work has proven beneficial to my debugging process, in which my rigorous and systematic eye for detail helps me get to the bottom of errors quickly.


#### Initiator 
After graduating from University I moved to Vancouver to experience a new city and culture. Keen to get the most out of the situation, I threw myself into work and volunteering opportunities, lending my spare time to the local Food Bank and the Vancouver International Film Festival. My adaptability and willingness to embrace this daunting change paid off, as I managed to build a strong support network and home away from home. My decision to enroll at Makers and embark on a career change into tech is owed partly to the confidence I gained from my experience abroad.

## Hobbies
- :movie_camera: Cinema. After moving to the Pacific North West to live out my David Lynch fantasy, I spent many evenings volunteering at Vancouver International Film Festival's independent theatre, which gave me unfettered access to their screenings and popcorn :yum:. I also had some ad hoc work as a production assistant on the set of some frightfully romantic Hallmark movies :scream::couplekiss:. 
- :notes: Music. Growing up, I learned to play the piano and violin, and even sung live at the Royal Albert Hall at the Junior Proms. More recently, I've satisfied my love for music through discovering new bands and artists and going to live concerts (maybe one day again soon?).
- :sunrise_over_mountains: The outdoors. Living in Vancouver, I had access to one of the most beautiful parts of the world on my doorstep. I made the most of it by spending my weekends hiking, skiing or taking photos on my Fujifilm camera :camera:. 
- :dog2: Animal lover. Shout out to Wesley, my parent's Labrador. You bring me so much joy and inspire me to wear my heart on my sleeve :two_hearts:.
