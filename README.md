Hello! I'm Symion, a junior full stack developer and recent Makers Academy graduate. With a commitment to self-improvement, over the last 6 months I have taken a dive head-first into the world of tech, eagerly gaining experience with a wide variety of technologies as well as practicing principles such as OOP, TDD, version control and Agile workflow. A career-changer, with extensive experience within higher education and the public sector, I am eager to continue my coding venture using my logic and creativity to build usable and intuitive products. 



## Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **[Triffid](https://github.com/samanthagottlieb/triffid)**            | Never kill your houseplants again! Built for my Makers final project, Triffid is a houseplant monitoring app designed to help users keep track of their leafy friends. We used Node.js and Express.js to create a fully RESTful backend, and React Native for the interface, facilitating use on both iOS and Android devices. Features include JWT authentication, the ability to add plants to a personal 'terrarium', and a connection to the Trefle API plant database. Read about my personal experience on this project [here](https://symion-edwards.medium.com/week-of-the-triffids-building-a-houseplant-app-for-my-bootcamp-final-project-225b59c816f7).   | MongoDB, Express.JS, React Native, Node.js, JWT, Jest, [Trefle API](https://trefle.io/)|
| **[Bragbook](https://github.com/CodeZeus-dev/acebook-SassBook)** | Finally, a social media platform unashamedly transparent with its intensions! Bragbook is a full stack Rails Facebook clone designed to make showing off about your life easy. This two week group project was my first introduction to the Ruby on Rails framework.  We worked in two day sprints using Agile processes, and followed CI/CD pipelines for rapid integration. Users can create an account, upload a profile picture, create/update/delete/edit posts, like and comment on posts and add friends. | Ruby on Rails, Rspec, Capybara, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Travis CI, Heroku |
| **[Sym's Pins](https://github.com/sedwards93/bowling-challenge)** | Who knew that the logic behind 10 pin bowling was so intricate?! Sym's Pins is my attempt creating a bowling scorecard that allows a user to keep track of their score across a 10 frame game of bowling. Test-driven with the Jasmine framework, and written using JavaScript ES6 classes, this project was my first dive into object orientated design in JavaScript. The user interface is written using HTML, CSS and the jQuery library for JavaScript. The app is deployed on [Heroku.](https://sympinbowling.herokuapp.com/) | JavaScript, jQuery, Jasmine, HTML, CSS, Heroku |
| **[symion.co.uk](https://github.com/sedwards93/symion.co.uk)** | An exercise in design, I worked on this single page application to refine my front end design process. Through creating website mock-ups using Figma, I was able to see through my design from conception to completion, creating a fully-responsive splash-screen website with links to my professional socials. I deployed my serverless website using [Netlify.](https://www.symion.co.uk/)  | Figma, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Netlify |

## Skills
#### Communicator
I have channelled my passion for written communication through my personal blog, where I have shared articles through Medium's largest publication, the Start-up, with over 700,000 active followers, as well as winning the bi-annual Maker's blogging competition. My aptitude for confident and concise communication stems from my science background, whereby my Biology degree helped develop my analytical and research skills, and taught me to approach problems methodically and rationally. I have an aptitude for assimilating information, statistical analysis and written communication.  I have carried through this rigorous approach and applied it to my professional career, having recently supported the University of East Anglia’s Sustainability, Utilities and Engineering team research, edit and write their annual environmental report.

#### Initiator 
After graduating from University I moved to Vancouver to experience a new city and culture.  Keen to get the most out of the situation, I threw myself into volunteering opportunities, lending my spare time to the local Food Bank and the Vancouver International Film Festival and managed to build a home away from home.
